The relationship between manager performance ratings and the financial value they bring to an organization is a complex and multi-faceted issue. While the direct evidence linking higher manager performance ratings to increased economic or financial value in organizations is not explicitly outlined, several studies provide insights into related aspects of this relationship:

1. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) approach, integrating both financial and non-financial performance measures, suggests that non-financial aspects (like human resource skills) can directly affect financial results. This implies that better-performing managers, who likely contribute positively to these non-financial aspects, could enhance financial performance [(Bento, Bento, & White, 2013)](https://consensus.app/papers/validating-causeandeffect-relationships-balanced-bento/ac5d56b8223c56e2a554d40fc736c51a/?utm_source=chatgpt).

2. The Actions-to-Value framework indicates that managerial behavior is linked to long-term organizational value. While not directly correlating performance ratings with financial returns, this framework suggests that managerial actions, presumably influenced by their performance level, have a pathway to impacting long-term value [(Ballou, Heitger, & Schultz, 2010)](https://consensus.app/papers/actionstovalue-framework-linking-managerial-behavior-ballou/6e7417e9f54f55a8b4582023cabde640/?utm_source=chatgpt).

3. A study on corporate performance measurement emphasizes the importance of both financial and social performance aspects. While this doesn't directly address manager performance ratings, it highlights the multidimensional nature of performance assessment, which could be relevant to evaluating manager contributions [(Szwajkowski & Figlewicz, 1999)](https://consensus.app/papers/evaluating-corporate-performance-comparison-fortune-szwajkowski/3745bd8e3f6a5c409fcf644fbb9a4045/?utm_source=chatgpt).

4. Research on the relationship between strategic human resource involvement and organizational performance found that integrating human resource functions into business strategy enhances financial performance. This suggests that higher-rated managers, who are likely more strategically involved, could positively impact financial outcomes [(Darwish & Singh, 2013)](https://consensus.app/papers/does-resource-involvement-devolvement-enhance-darwish/9012675934f35489a2f96ab08c654f4e/?utm_source=chatgpt).

5. The study on senior management team culture and hospital performance indicates that management culture is associated with organizational performance. High-performing managers may contribute to a positive culture, which in turn could affect financial outcomes [(Davies et al., 2007)](https://consensus.app/papers/exploring-relationship-senior-management-team-culture-davies/11e07fb10d455bbb95ef7f3e3eef4436/?utm_source=chatgpt).

In conclusion, while there is no direct evidence to conclusively state that managers with higher performance ratings bring more economic or financial value compared to those with lower ratings, various studies suggest a positive influence of effective managerial performance, strategic involvement, and cultural impact on organizational financial outcomes. The link between higher manager performance ratings and the compensation they receive, and whether this offsets their financial contribution to the organization, remains an area for further research.
