Write five learning objectives to measure the most relevant knowledge and skills in a course to improve critical thinking. Two of the learning objectives should measure knowledge. Three of the learning objectives should measure skill. Include the conditions, behavior, and measurement in the learning objective.


Learning objectives are crucial for setting clear expectations in a course, guiding both instruction and assessment. Here are five learning objectives specifically designed for a course on improving critical thinking, with two focused on measuring knowledge and three on measuring skills:

1. **Knowledge Objective (Understanding Concepts):**
   - **Condition:** After completing the module on logical fallacies,
   - **Behavior:** the learner will be able to identify and describe
   - **Measurement:** at least five common logical fallacies from given examples with 90% accuracy.

2. **Knowledge Objective (Theoretical Understanding):**
   - **Condition:** At the end of the course,
   - **Behavior:** the learner will be able to explain
   - **Measurement:** the principles of sound reasoning and how they apply to constructing arguments, as assessed through a written examination where they must achieve a score of at least 85%.

3. **Skill Objective (Application of Knowledge):**
   - **Condition:** Given a set of diverse viewpoints in a classroom discussion,
   - **Behavior:** the learner will demonstrate the ability to apply critical thinking skills by analyzing arguments,
   - **Measurement:** distinguishing between facts and opinions, and justifying their perspectives, culminating in a peer-reviewed critique session where they must receive a satisfactory rating on at least 80% of the provided criteria.

4. **Skill Objective (Problem-Solving):**
   - **Condition:** When presented with a complex real-world problem in a case study,
   - **Behavior:** the learner will apply critical thinking techniques to identify underlying assumptions, evaluate alternatives, and
   - **Measurement:** propose a well-reasoned solution, which will be assessed through a scoring rubric where a score of 4 out of 5 or better must be achieved for the clarity and logic of the reasoning.

5. **Skill Objective (Critical Analysis):**
   - **Condition:** Using scholarly articles on a controversial topic,
   - **Behavior:** the learner will critically assess the strength of the evidence and arguments presented,
   - **Measurement:** and synthesize a coherent evaluation in a written report, graded for depth of analysis and adherence to academic standards of argumentation, achieving at least a 'B' grade.

These objectives ensure a balance between theoretical knowledge and practical application, pivotal for enhancing critical thinking capabilities in a structured learning environment.
